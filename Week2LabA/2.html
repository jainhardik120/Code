            Everything is F*cked by Mark Manson
        </u>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Everything is F*cked is an <strong><em>in-depth,</em></strong> textbook about understanding
        <strong><em>your</em></strong>
        feelings so you can ultimately find freedom and a bit more joy in <strong><em>your</strong></em>
        life. Mark Manson gives <strong><em>us</strong></em> never-heard-before life tips that can upgrade
        <strong><em>your</em></strong> physical being so <strong><em>you</em></strong> can stop obsessing over quick
        wins. Along with
        the you-definitely-need-to-read advice, he presents us with a way to find
        meaning in <strong><em>this</em></strong> world of a never-ending stream of
        <strong><em>unnecessary</em></strong> information.
        Also, explains far better than the pope the whole religion thing and even
        how <strong><em>you</em></strong> can start <strong><em>your</em></strong> own cult.
